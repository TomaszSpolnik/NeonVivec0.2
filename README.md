# NeonVivec0.2
A simple tool with handy GUI designed for quick edition of config.lua and tes3mp-server-default.cfg from tes3mp multiplayer mod that is based on openMW Morrowind project.

It enables user to quickly do changes like server name, password, number of players, sharing map, bounties and so on. 

Updated from previous amateurish approch, without .bat files for publication on [Nexus m](https://www.nexusmods.com). 

Written in python with PyQt6. Tested on tes3mp.Win64.prerelease.0.7-alpha and tes3mp.Win64.prerelease.0.8-alpha.

How to use:

When program starts (either through .py script or through .exe file) a window pops up asking user to select a folder with the tes3mp mod: 
"tes3mp.Win64.prerelease.0.7-alpha" or "tes3mp.Win64.prerelease.0.8-alpha". 

This is where all of the config files are stored. 

It updates config files on the fly.

All credtis to the original mod are stored in the text file.
